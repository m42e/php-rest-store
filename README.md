# PHP REST Store

A Simple php script which allows you to keep track of some data on your server.

It does not use databases just simple files and offers a simple as possible interface.
I use it to share some shell commands, I want to demonstate to other or transfer links that are much to complicated, snippets I don't want to send by mail, ....

There is also a small shell script for piping to this api or getting some things of it [here](https://github.com/m42e/shell-rest-store.git)
